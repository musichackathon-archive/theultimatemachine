Welcome to the_ultimate_machine.py

the_ultimate_machine.py is a deeply meta music creation script / framework.
It runs its OWN TEXT through the algorithm that it defines.  
To use the_ultimate_machine.py, simple replace the below parsing code with code of your own
Note that to run the_ultimate_machine.py properly, you should remove ALL comments, 
except for the shabang and encoding, and compact the code as much as possible.  
This version uses abjad and lilypond to create scores.  
You may use any midi, audio, or score-creation libraries, so long as the script only points to itself.
